# Challenge 1: Excess rentals in TfL bike sharing

Recall the TfL data on how many bikes were hired every single day. We can get the latest data by running the following:

```{r, get_tfl_data, cache=TRUE}
url <- "https://data.london.gov.uk/download/number-bicycle-hires/ac29363e-e0cb-47cc-a97a-e216d900a6b0/tfl-daily-cycle-hires.xlsx"

# Download TFL data to temporary file
httr::GET(url, write_disk(bike.temp <- tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx")))

# Use read_excel to read it as dataframe
bike0 <- read_excel(bike.temp,
                   sheet = "Data",
                   range = cell_cols("A:B"))

# change dates to get year, month, and week
bike <- bike0 %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename (bikes_hired = number_of_bicycle_hires) %>% 
  mutate (year = year(day),
          month = lubridate::month(day, label = TRUE),
          week = isoweek(day))
```


```{r}
bike0 <- bike %>% 
  filter(year>=2016&year<=2019) %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% 
  summarise(expected_rental = mean(bikes_hired))

bike1 <- bike %>% 
  filter(year>=2016) %>% 
  group_by(year,month) %>% 
  summarise(actual_rental = mean(bikes_hired))

bike_month <- merge(bike0, bike1, by = "month") %>% 
  mutate(excess_rentals = actual_rental - expected_rental, 
         positive = ifelse(actual_rental > expected_rental, excess_rentals, 0),
         negative = ifelse(actual_rental < expected_rental, excess_rentals, 0))

```

```{r}
ggplot(bike_month, aes(month)) +
  geom_line(aes(x=month, y=expected_rental, colour="expected", group=year), size = 0.6, show.legend = FALSE) + 
  geom_line(aes(x=month, y=actual_rental, colour="actual", group=year), size = 0.2, show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=expected_rental, ymax=expected_rental + positive, group=year), alpha = 0.3, fill = "palegreen3") +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=expected_rental + negative, ymax=expected_rental, group=year), alpha = 0.3, fill = "firebrick3") +

    panel.background = element_rect(color = "White", fill = "White"),
    panel.grid = element_line(color = "Grey", size = 0.1),
    strip.text.x = element_text(size = 7, color = "black"),
    strip.background = element_rect(color = "White", fill = "White", size = 0),
    panel.border = element_blank(),
    axis.text=element_text(size=6),
    axis.ticks = element_blank()) +
  facet_wrap(~ year, scales = "free") +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "Bike Rentals", title = "Monthly changes in TfL bike rentals", subtitle = "Change from monthly average shown in blue and calculated between 2016-2019")
