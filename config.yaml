    subtitle: "Born in Milan and grown up close to the picturesque Como Lake, Nicolò holds multiple 
               nationalities given the origins of his family. Italy, Belgium and Germany are the countries 
               influencing his background. Nicolò has an endless passion for winter sports and outdoor activities.
               One of his most trusted friends is his drone, which he brings along to capture unique moments."
